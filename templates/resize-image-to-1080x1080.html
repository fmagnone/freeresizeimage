<h3 class="mb-4">Why do you need an image resizer 1080x1080?</h3>

<p>If you want to free resize your image to optimize it for multiple uses and platforms one of the most used and recommended sizes is 1080x1080 pixels. This dimension will ensure your images have good quality and render properly on most social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Linkedin. We also recommend having a larger image with a higher quality of 1600x1600 pixels.</p>

<p>On summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>300x300px - Thumbnail</li>
<li>1080x1080px - Regular</li>
<li>1600x1600px - Large</li>
</ul>
